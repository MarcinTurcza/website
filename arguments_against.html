    <h1>Here are the top Arguments To Prove Global Warming Isn't Real:</h1>
    <br>
    <p
    class = "medium center">
    Many scientists make a strong case against global warming being real. They often look towards the same evidence as those in favor of proving its existence but draw different conclusions. They also look at some evidence not considered in other arguments. These scientists hold to a strict definition of global warming as being defined as a rise in atmospheric temperature; they do not consider the atmospheric precursors as valid evidence.

        First Argument - No Significant and Prolonged Temperature Changes Since 1997 
        <br>
        <br>
        Scientists who argue against global warming say global warming isn't real because since the 90s there hasn't been a significant temperature change. The upswing in the temperature started from 1975, continued till 1997, and the temperature has been flat since then, which clearly states that there isn't any significant change in temperature in the last 17 years.

        The natural variability, volcanic eruptions, and relatively low solar activity, the rate of average global surface warming from 1998-2012 were slower than it had been for two to three decades leading up to it that raise the slowdown into a slogan: “Global warming stopped in 1998.”
        In scientific journals and assessment reports, climate experts described the episode as a “pause” or “hiatus” in the previous decades' rapid warming.

        <br>
        Second Argument  - Not Enough Historical Data Available
        <br>
        <br>
        There is no consensus about global warming being real among scientists. Advocates also point towards the fact that a recent gathering of 31,000 scientists in the field of environmental science couldn't reach a consensus on whether or not global warming is real. They believe that they don't have long term historical climate data, or the data they have isn't clear.

We search for the clearest indicators of climate change that we can present to the public so that they can understand what is happening, face reality, and adapt.

        Third Argument - Arctic Ice Increased by 50% Since 2012
 
        <br>
        <br>
        Arctic ice increased in volume by 50% in 2012 alone. Core measures of the Arctic ice show that it has increased in volume since 2012, which argues against global warming, causing ice caps to melt.

Climate Depot reported that the latest figures from the National Snow and Ice Data Center, located at the University of Colorado, show that sea ice extent has increased by 40 percent since 2012 - The Danish Polar Portal, which monitors ice and climate in the Arctic, reported on the 12th of September this year.

Few people have even predicted that global warming would cause whole Arctic ice to melt, which contradicts their version.
        <br>
        <br>
        Fourth Argument - Climate Models used are Proven to be Unreliable 
        <br>
        <br>
        The climate model calculations used to predict the effect of global warming have been proven to be flawed, which means that the long term predictions that they have been making are meaningless. Some scientists even argue that any increase in global temperatures could be a natural climate shift.
        It is important to note that computer models cannot exactly predict the future, since there are so many unknowns concerning what might happen. Scientists model a range of possible future climates using different scenarios of what the world will look like.

Each scenario makes different assumptions about important factors. The resulting projection of the future climate for each scenario gives various possibilities for the temperature but within a defined range.
        <br>
        <br>
        Fifth Argument - Early Predictions about the Effects of Warming Have Been Proven Wrong
        <br>
        <br>
        Advocates who promote arguments against global warming being real, point towards all the dates that have come and gone where predictions were made about effects that never happened. Some instances of wrong predictions are: 
        <br>
1) Al Gore predicted that all Arctic ice would be gone by 2013. But, on the contrary, Arctic ice is up by 50% since 2012.
        <br>
2) In January 1970, Life reported, “Scientists have solid experimental and theoretical evidence to support…the following predictions: In a decade, urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution…by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half….”. But the case is not the same till now.
        <br>
3) Climate, preacher/scientist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, predicted last year that “We’re like… the world is gonna end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change.” We are to see whether this prediction made last year around the time of Earth Day 2019 will materialize.
