    <h1>Here are the top arguments to prove global warming is real:</h1>
    <br>
    <p
    class = "medium center">
    There is many scientists who argue that global warming is real and base most of their evidence interpreting the change in the levels of gases in the atmosphere and the ocean.

They say that actual warming of temperature is something they can document, but the main evidence is drawn from detecting what precedes a temperature rise - the change and effect of atmospheric gases on the Earth's environment.
        <br>
        <br>
        First Argument - Rise in Sea Level 
        <br>
        <br>
        In many areas of the world sea level is rising. Part of the cause is said to be the melting of ice caps and glaciers, but more is atributed to the gases contained in the sea and their changes . Just in the last 10 years the global mean sea levels have doubled compared to the 20th-century trend of 1.6 mm per year and is accelerating slightly every year. The global sea levels rose about 8 inches in the last century. According to a research climate change-driven accelerated sea-level rise detected in the altimeter era and it says, if sea level continues to change at this rate and acceleration, sea-level rise by 2100 (approx 65 cm) will be more than double the amount if the rate was constant at 3 mm/y.

        <br>
        Second Argument  - Rise in Earth's Average Temperature 
        <br>
        <br>
        In the past century and a half global temperature continues to rise.  The global atmospheric temperature is being tracked since the 1800s , It's being pointed out by scientists that the steady rise was observed with a stronger period in the 70s, a halt in the rise  in the 90s and a return to the rising pattern in the 2000s.

Since the late 19th century, the planet's average surface temperature has risen by about 0.9 degrees Celsius,  a change is said to be driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere.

Majority of the warming occurred just in the past 35 years, with the six warmest years on record taking place since 2014. NASA, NOAA Data Show, not only was 2016 the warmest year on record, but eight out of the total 12 months that make up the year from January through September, with the exception of June were the warmest on record for those respective months.
        <br>
        <br>
        Third Argument - Rise in Ocean Temperature 
        <br>
        <br>
        The rise in the number of vehicles and industries has resulted in greenhouse gases getting trapped in the atmosphere. The increased heat in the atmosphere from greenhouse gas emissions has been absorbed by the oceans with the top 700 meters (about 2,300 feet) of ocean showing warming of more than 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1969.

        There are over 50 years of documented temperature records for the oceans that have recorded a steady rise in its temperature since 1969.
        In addition, 2019 was the warmest in the 65-year record of ocean observations, based on the analysis by researchers from NCEI and the Institute of Atmospheric Physics in Beijing. The five highest years on record for annual ocean heat content (OHC) are 2015-2019. “These data reveal that the world oceans were the warmest in recorded human history in 2019,” the authors concluded.
        <br>
        <br>
        Fourth Argument - Shrinking Glaciers 
        <br>
        <br>
        Glaciers are so sensitive to temperature fluctuations that they provide clues about the effects of global warming. The glaciers on several mountain ranges, particularly in Greenland and Antarctica, are decreasing in size due to the reduction in gases that help to maintain temperatures and changes in the region's climate. This is the case almost everywhere around the world including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa.

Studies conducted by NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost 36 to 60 cubic miles of ice every year between 2000 and 2006.
        <br>
        <br>
        Fifth Argument - Ocean Acidification
        <br>
        <br>
        Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 30 percent. The acid level in the ocean is increasing, which is making the oceans of the world more acidic.

This is due to the emission of more harmful gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by humans, which is getting absorbed by the oceans. This is resulting in an increase of algae blooms and mass fish deaths, as well as a change to the chemical composition of the water.
The amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the upper layer of the oceans is increasing by about 2 billion tons per year.
