    Global warming is a very hot topic these days. The debate over global warming has been going all around the world. While few consider it as its biggest challenge of all times, others consider it as a climate shift that occurred in the early 90s and has fallen flat since then.

            Those who believe global warming has their own scientific reasons to back their claims; others have their own reasons to disregard their theory. Understanding global warming and its impact is important to meet the challenges posed by it.
